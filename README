  Dynamic Distributed Compiler Network
 ======================================

Dependencies:

  The program depends on the following libraries which either have to be
  installed system-wide or have to be in the build prefix passed to cmake:

  - ariba (>=0.7)
  - mcpo (>=0.5)
  - Qt4
  - OpenSSL (>=0.9.8)
  - log4cxx

  It is strongly advised to build ariba with log4cxx support to enable logging
  ariba messages to the ddcn log file.

  Additionally, to compile the project, gcc/g++ and cmake are required.

Compiling:

  The following steps will compile the project within the subdirectory build/,
  this assumes that the current working directory is the directory where this
  README is:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

  Optionally, you can install all executables system-wide by additionally
  executing:

    sudo make install

  If you do not want to install it system-wide you can install into a different
  prefix by replacing the "cmake .." above with:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/your/prefix

  If you call cmake like this, it will also find libraries installed in that
  prefix.

Running:

  To run the graphical interface, run:

    build/bin/ddcn_control

  To only start the service without any GUI, run:

    build/bin/ddcn_service

  (if you installed the programs system-wide, leave out the build/bin)

  To compile a C file after the service has been started (directly or through
  the GUI), run:

    build/bin/ddcn_gcc /path/to/the/file.c -o output_file

  To compile a C++ file:

    export PATH=/current/working/dir/build/bin
    ddcn_gcc/ddcn_g++ /path/to/the/file.cpp -o output_file

  If you are using this with a makefile generator like autotools or cmake, make
  sure that both ddcn_gcc and ddcn_g++ are in your PATH, then set them as
  CC/CXX programs.

Documentation:

  There is a user documentation in the docs/ directory, under
  docs/UserDocumentation.pdf. If you have received this copy of ddcn directly
  from mercurial, only the LaTeX sources are included, you have to build the PDF
  through pdflatex:

    cd docs
    pdflatex UserDocumentation.tex

  Additional docuimentation can be found under the following address, this
  includes a short guide into the internal design of ddcn:

    http://code.google.com/p/ddcn/

  Internal doxygen documentation can be generated with the Doxyfile files in the
  subdirectories ddcn_service, ddcn_gcc and ddcn_control like this:

    cd ddcn_service
    doxygen

  The resulting documentation is at docs/ddcn_service/html/index.html.
